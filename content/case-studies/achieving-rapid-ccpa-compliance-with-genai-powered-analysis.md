### Problem Statement
California's CCPA laws forced our client to analyze 5,000+ company privacy policies to track potential data sales. Speed was important to gain a competitive advantage.

### How did BeautifulCode do it?

### Challenges Encountered During Implementation
Handling Ambiguous Policy Language:
Privacy policies' vagueness makes AI interpretation difficult. Our solution combined AI flagging of unclear areas with human-in-the-loop feedback, allowing for continuous AI improvement.

Finding Relevant Policy Snippets with RAG
The RAG model's broad retrieval hindered CCPA-specific analysis. We improved it by refining queries with CCPA-centric keywords and providing the model with labeled training examples for better focus.

### Solution
We developed a LangChain tool to retrieve relevant policy document sections, summarize the content, and analyze the summary for potential CCPA violations.
