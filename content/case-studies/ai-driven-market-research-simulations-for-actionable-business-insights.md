### How did BeautifulCode do it?

### Challenges Encountered During Implementation
Profile Realism: Ensuring AI-generated profiles accurately reflected human responses; overcame by grounding in real interview transcripts.

Scalability: Handling large volumes of transcripts; overcame with optimized cloud-native pipelines.

Insight Trust: Building customer trust in AI responses; solved with transparent methodology and validation loops.

### Solution
Developed an AI system that created profiles from real data and simulated responses, accelerating research cycles and improving decision confidence.

### Overview of Delivery Methodology
Step 1 – Discovery: Understood analyst workflows and bottlenecks in research reporting.

Step 2 – Architecture: Designed modular system using RAG with LlamaIndex, Celery, and Qdrant.

Step 3 – Implementation: Built ingestion, retrieval, and report generation pipelines with streaming SSE.

Step 4 – UX Design: Delivered interactive editor with verification loops and inline diff review.

Step 5 – Iteration: Piloted with analysts, collected feedback, and refined workflows.
