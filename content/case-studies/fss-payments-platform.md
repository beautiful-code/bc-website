### How did BeautifulCode do it?

The collaboration began with a **two-week domain immersion** combining FSSTech’s payments expertise with BC’s software delivery practices. The teams also implemented the **Remote Engineering Framework (REF)** onboarding to streamline alignment for distributed execution. 

To adapt to evolving business needs, BC introduced a **parallel “Product Sprint”** that ran alongside development sprints. Core participants included Product Managers and an Engineering Lead, focusing on:

- Evaluating technical viability of proposed features  
- Breaking down requirements into iterative, shippable slices  
- Unblocking upcoming development work (API exploration, 3rd-party assessments, POCs, etc.)

### Managing product, development, and launch velocity

Running a dedicated Product Sprint in parallel enabled faster decision-making, clarified scope ahead of each dev sprint, and protected delivery teams from last-minute churn—improving flow while keeping the roadmap responsive to market changes.

### Conclusion

BC built a **PCI-compliant**, white-labeled, cloud-native payments platform rivaling established leaders. At project completion, all accumulated knowledge, training, and the entire codebase were **transferred to FSSTech’s internal teams** to ensure long-term ownership and velocity.
