### How did BeautifulCode do it?

### Challenges Encountered During Implementation
Support and Standardize Offline Learning
Enabled effective traditional note-taking within a cohesive digital experience, ensuring seamless integration of offline methods into the overall learning platform.

Identify Key Feedback Touchpoints
Studied effective learning workflows and seamlessly integrated AI and human mentor feedback into the platform to enhance the learning experience.

Personalize the Learning Experience
Analyzed learner performance to adaptively provide personalized follow-ups, including hands-on exercises and application projects, enhancing individual learning paths

### Solution
Implemented researched learning methodologies, leveraged GenAI for continuous performance observation and feedback, digitized offline learning experiences, and scaled up quality mentor support for a superior, integrated learning platform

Technologies: OpenAI Foundation Models, React, Supabase

### Overview of Delivery Methodology
Step 1 - Research and Build 
Developed multiple proof of concepts for micro learning experiences.
Step 2 - Brainstorm and Propose 
Formulated and proposed philosophical models of learning.
Step 3 - Roadmap Creation
Broke down desired features into a prioritized development roadmap.
Step 4 - Kanban Implementation 
Launched features incrementally using the Kanban method.
