### How did BeautifulCode do it?

### Challenges Encountered During Implementation
Challenges encountered during implementation:
Integrating varied formats like technical documentation, service catalogs, and video transcripts to create a unified, queryable knowledge base for the RAG system.

### Solution
We built an AI-powered conversational sales agent. It uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model over technical documentation, videos, and a service catalog to guide customers to optimal solutions.

### Overview of Delivery Methodology
Step 1 - Knowlege base construction: We processed & indexed different files into unified content optimized for RAG

Step 2 - Prototype Development: Developed a prototype conversational agent in iterative cycle. 

Step 3: Application Integration: Developed an AI platform to integrate the conversation agent and provide end to end experience for the user
