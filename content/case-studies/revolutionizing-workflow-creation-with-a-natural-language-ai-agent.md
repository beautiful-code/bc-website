### How did BeautifulCode do it?

### Challenges Encountered During Implementation
Translating Ambiguous Language into Concrete Workflow Steps:
Natural language requests were often imprecise. The agent needed to be trained to resolve ambiguity, infer user intent, and map phrases to specific platform actions.

Ensuring the Logical Validity of Generated Workflows:
The AI could generate workflows with logical errors. We implemented a validator agent to check for correct data flow, dependencies, and platform-specific constraints.

### Solution
We delivered an agentic AI solution that interprets user requests in natural language. The agent plans, builds, and validates workflows by translating high-level goals into executable automation steps.

### Overview of Delivery Methodology
Step 1 – Discovery: Analyzed the automation platform’s components and defined the initial command scope.
Step 2 – Schema Design: Designed a structured schema of all workflow actions, triggers, and parameters.
Step 3 – Agent Development: Built the agentic AI to translate natural language into logical workflow plans.
Step 4 – API Integration: Connected the AI agent to the platform's backend API to construct live workflows.
Step 5 – Deployment: Deployed the feature in phases with logging to monitor workflow generation success.
