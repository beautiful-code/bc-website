### How did BeautifulCode do it?

The collaboration kicked off with a two-week domain immersion session, integrating FSSTech's payments expertise and BeautifulCode's software development insights. This was complemented by implementing the Remote Engineering Framework (REF) onboarding process, streamlining alignment for remote engineering teams.

### Managing Product, Development and Launch velocity

To adapt to the dynamic nature of business changes, BeautifulCode introduced a separate "Product Sprint" which runs in parallel to the development sprint. The core participants in these sprints included Product Managers and the Engineering Lead. The primary objectives of the Product Sprint are as follows:

- Evaluate and discuss the technical viability of suggested product features  
- Deconstruct product requirements into manageable and iterative features  
- Handle potential obstacles for the upcoming development sprint which involved activities such as understanding API documentation, exploring third-party solutions, conducting proof of concept (POC), etc.



### Conclusion

BeautifulCode built a competitive white-labeled, PCI Compliant, cloud native solution with features on par with the industry leaders like Stripe. The product served different personas such as Merchants, SubMerchants, Independent Software Vendors and Payment Facilitators. Upon project completion, all accumulated knowledge, training, and the entirety of the code base were successfully transferred to the internal teams at FSSTech.
