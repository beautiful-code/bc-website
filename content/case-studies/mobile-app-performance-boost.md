FitnessTrack came to BC with a critical challenge: their popular fitness tracking app was suffering from severe performance issues that were driving users away and hurting their business growth.

The app was taking 8+ seconds to load, frequently crashed during workout tracking, and had poor responsiveness that frustrated users trying to log their fitness activities in real-time.

### How did BC do it?

Our team conducted a comprehensive performance audit and identified three critical bottlenecks: inefficient data fetching, memory leaks in workout tracking components, and unoptimized image loading.

We implemented a multi-phase optimization strategy:

**Phase 1: Code Optimization**

- Refactored React Native components to eliminate unnecessary re-renders
- Implemented lazy loading for workout history data
- Added efficient caching mechanisms for frequently accessed user data

```javascript
// Optimized workout data fetching
const useWorkoutData = () => {
  return useQuery(["workouts"], fetchWorkouts, {
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
    cacheTime: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes
  });
};
```

**Phase 2: Infrastructure Improvements**

- Migrated image assets to AWS CloudFront CDN
- Implemented API response compression
- Added database query optimization for user metrics

### Conclusion

The performance optimization delivered exceptional results that exceeded FitnessTrack's expectations and significantly improved user experience.

| Metric            | Before | After | Improvement |
| ----------------- | ------ | ----- | ----------- |
| App Launch Time   | 8.2s   | 2.1s  | 75%         |
| User Retention    | 45%    | 63%   | 40%         |
| Crash Rate        | 15%    | 1.5%  | 90%         |
| User Satisfaction | 2.8/5  | 4.6/5 | 64%         |

The optimized app now provides a smooth, responsive experience that keeps users engaged with their fitness goals. FitnessTrack has seen their highest user satisfaction scores ever and continues to grow their active user base.
