### How did BeautifulCode do it?

### Challenges Encountered During Implementation

Complex Cadence Management: Multiple routines with weekly, monthly, and quarterly frequencies required flexible scheduling logic.

User Adoption: Teams accustomed to ad-hoc communication needed intuitive UI to trust and adopt the tool.

Integration Gaps: Bridging data flow with existing tools like spreadsheets and email without disrupting workflows.

### Solution

Built an AI-powered delegation platform to capture, organize, and track recurring tasks, offering visibility, reminders, and structured templates for repeatable routines, improving accountability and reducing oversight effort.

### Overview of Delivery Methodology

Step 1 – Discovery: Workshops with stakeholders to capture recurring routine pain points.

Step 2 – Design: Created lo-fi mocks and cadence visualization options for clarity.

Step 3 – Development: Built modular frontend and backend with FastAPI and React.

Step 4 – AI Integration: Added templates and intelligent reminders for task delegation.

Step 5 – Deployment & Training: Piloted with small groups, then scaled across departments.
