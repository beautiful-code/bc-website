### How did BeautifulCode do it?

### Challenges Encountered During Implementation
Delayed Roll-outs due to dependency on External agenices

Maintaining consistent tone and terminology across languages

Implemented a GenAI-based solution to automate translations, reducing turnaround times and accelerating global launches with a consistent tone.

### Solution
Our solution addressed the customer’s challenges by employing GenAI and building an internal Python backend with the LangChain package, providing context for accurate translations and manual verification for cultural relevance.

### Overview of Delivery Methodology
Step 1 - Proof of Concept with supporting 1 language
Identified the appropriate React framework and the suitable LLM model for localization in the client's web app.

Step 2 - GenAI-powered translation 
Used Llama-3 and a python based backend system to automate the translation processes. 

Step 3 - Optimization 
Optimized translation accuracy by providing additional context in the prompts.

Step 4 - Manual verification process. 
Generated translations were manually verified by a translator for errors and cultural context.
