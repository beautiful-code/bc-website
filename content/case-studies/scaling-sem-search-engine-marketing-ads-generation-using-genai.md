### How did BeautifulCode do it?

### Challenges Encountered During Implementation
Defining High-Quality SEM Ads
To define the key elements of a high-quality SEM ad, we collaborated with experts experienced in crafting successful SEM campaigns. Their valuable insights were then incorporated into a refined prompt for generating top-performing ads.

Ensuring Up-to-Date Tourist Attraction Information
We deployed agents to gather the latest details on tourist attractions. This ensured that our generated SEM ads remained accurate and relevant to recent changes or developments.

### Solution
We harnessed LangChain and the Serper API to dynamically gather property information, ensuring generated SEM ads were high-quality, accurate, and aligned with business goals.

Technologies: Python, LangChain, LangSmith, StreamLit, Gemini, Serper Tool, FastAPI

### Overview of Delivery Methodology
Step 1: Understand the Problem
We spent time with the client to understand the problem they were trying to solve. We ensured the right people were involved in the meetings.

Step 2: Rapid prototyping & Iteration
We built a rapid prototype using Streamlit and deployed it to Hugging Face for the business analysts to assess the quality of the outputs. We refined the prompt based on the feedback we recieved using LangSmith.

Step 3: Deployment
We built API endpoints using FastAPI and deployed them for consumption by other services.
