### How did BeautifulCode do it?

### Challenges Encountered During Implementation
Codifying Human Analyst Expertise:

Translating the nuanced strategies of expert SEM analysts into structured, machine-readable guidelines for the AI agent required significant knowledge engineering and prompt refinement.

### Solution
We developed a multi-agent AI system. It researches campaign goals, analyzes performance data, and uses an critic agent to generate high-intent Phrase and Exact Match keywords.

### Overview of Delivery Methodology
Step 1: Discovery: Collaborated with SEM Analyst to understand the problem & document guidelines

Step 2: Architecture: Created the high level agentic design which involved a critic agent to assess the Keywords created by the AI agent

Step 3: Development: Developed the agentic solution and integrated it with the UI providing a Human In The Loop solution.
