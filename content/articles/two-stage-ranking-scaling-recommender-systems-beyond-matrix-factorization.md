### The Computational Constraint

Building recommender systems for millions of items creates an impossible computational problem—ranking every candidate in real-time isn't feasible. The two-stage architecture solves this by splitting the problem: candidate generation retrieves 100-1000 potentially relevant items using fast approximate methods, while the ranking stage applies expensive models to this smaller set. This architectural choice transforms an O(n) problem into O(k) where k << n, making sub-100ms latencies achievable at scale.

### Choosing Your Retrieval Strategy

| Strategy | Strengths | Cold-Start Handling | Computational Cost |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Collaborative Filtering | Captures implicit user-item patterns | Poor - needs interaction history | Low (matrix operations) |
| Content-Based Filtering | Works with item features alone | Good - no history required | Medium (feature matching) |
| Hybrid Approach | Balances both signals | Moderate - degrades gracefully | Medium-High |

Collaborative filtering excels when you have dense interaction data but fails for new users or items. Content-based filtering uses item metadata to make recommendations even without user history. Production systems typically combine both, using collaborative filtering as the primary signal and content-based as a fallback for cold-start scenarios.

### Moving Beyond Linear Assumptions

Matrix factorization learns user and item embeddings but assumes their interaction is a simple dot product—a linear relationship. Neural collaborative filtering replaces this with deep networks that learn non-linear interaction functions. The trade-off is computational: matrix factorization trains faster and serves predictions in microseconds, while neural approaches require more GPU time but capture complex patterns like "users who like jazz and sci-fi also enjoy abstract art." The choice depends on whether your domain exhibits strong non-linear user preferences.

### Applied Insight: Training Dynamics Matter

Negative sampling strategy profoundly impacts model quality. Random negatives create easy training examples; the model learns trivial distinctions. Sampling popular items as negatives forces the model to learn subtle preference signals—why a user chose item A over the also-popular item B. Additionally, position bias in click data corrupts training: top-ranked items get more clicks regardless of relevance. Inverse propensity scoring reweights training examples by their position, debiasing the learned model. For exploration, epsilon-greedy or Thompson sampling prevents filter bubbles by occasionally recommending outside the user's predicted preferences.
