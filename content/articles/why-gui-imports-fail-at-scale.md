keytakeaway: "LOAD DATA INFILE achieves 10-50x throughput over GUI imports by streaming rows directly into storage, eliminating per-row SQL overhead, and deferring index maintenance until after bulk insert completes."

### The Problem with GUI-Based CSV Imports

Most database GUIs treat bulk imports as convenience features, not performance primitives. Tools like MySQL Workbench or phpMyAdmin send row-by-row INSERT statements over JDBC or ODBC, triggering per-statement parsing, query planning, and transaction overhead. Each row incurs network round-trips between client and server, autocommit writes to disk, and immediate index maintenance. For datasets beyond a few thousand rows, this chatty protocol becomes a bottleneck. The fundamental issue is architectural: GUIs abstract away the storage layer, treating every row as a discrete SQL statement rather than a streaming bulk operation.

### LOAD DATA Streams Directly into Storage

"LOAD DATA INFILE" bypasses SQL execution for individual rows. It parses the file format once, validates column mappings, and writes rows directly to the storage engine in bulk. This eliminates per-row query overhead and leverages MySQL's internal batching mechanisms. The statement handles format parsing inline with clauses like "FIELDS TERMINATED BY" and "ENCLOSED BY", and supports transformation via column variables.

**Code Snippet:**
```sql
LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE '/data/transactions.csv'
INTO TABLE staging_txn
CHARACTER SET utf8mb4
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 LINES
(@raw_date, @raw_amount, merchant_id, category)
SET 
  txn_date = STR_TO_DATE(@raw_date, '%Y-%m-%d'),
  amount = NULLIF(@raw_amount, '');
```

### LOCAL vs Server-Side Execution Context

"LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE" reads from the client filesystem and requires "local_infile=1" on both client and server. This works when the file lives on your laptop or CI runner. Server-side "LOAD DATA INFILE" reads from the database host's filesystem, subject to "secure_file_priv" restrictions, and avoids network transfer when the file is already staged on the server. For multi-gigabyte imports, shipping data over the network adds latency. If your ETL pipeline stages files on the DB host or uses mounted volumes in Docker, server-side mode eliminates that bottleneck.

### Defer Index Maintenance Until After Load

Loading into a table with multiple indexes forces MySQL to update every index structure per row. For bulk imports, disable "unique_checks" and "foreign_key_checks" at session level, or load into an unindexed staging table and add indexes afterward with "ALTER TABLE ADD INDEX". This reduces write amplification from O(n * indexes) to O(n) for the load, then O(n log n) for one batch index build. Wrapping the entire load in a single transaction also prevents intermediate commits and avoids repeated fsync calls.
