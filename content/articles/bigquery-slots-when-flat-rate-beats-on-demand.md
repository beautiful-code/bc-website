### Matching Pricing Models to Workload Patterns

Flat-rate pricing through slot commitments or autoscaling delivers predictable costs for workloads with steady daily baselines, like scheduled ETL pipelines or real-time dashboards with SLA requirements. On-demand pricing suits exploratory analytics, ad-hoc investigations, or bursty workloads where query volume fluctuates unpredictably. The decision hinges on whether you can forecast compute demand: if your pipeline runs 50+ queries daily with consistent data volumes, flat-rate eliminates per-query cost variance and caps spend.

The break-even point typically emerges around $10K monthly on-demand spend, but the real trigger is operational risk. When pipeline delays cascade into business impact, flat-rate reservations provide capacity guarantees that on-demand cannot match during regional saturation events.

### Isolation Through Reservations and Assignments

```terraform
# Terraform: Separate reservations by priority
resource "google_bigquery_reservation" "prod_etl" {
  name               = "prod-etl-reservation"
  location           = "US"
  slot_capacity      = 500
  ignore_idle_slots  = false
}

resource "google_bigquery_reservation_assignment" "etl_project" {
  assignee    = "projects/my-etl-project"
  job_type    = "QUERY"
  reservation = google_bigquery_reservation.prod_etl.id
}

resource "google_bigquery_reservation" "analytics" {
  name          = "analytics-adhoc"
  slot_capacity = 100
  ignore_idle_slots = true  # Let ETL borrow idle slots
}
```

**Description:** This configuration isolates production ETL from analyst queries by creating dedicated reservations. The ETL reservation gets 500 slots with strict boundaries, while the analytics reservation allows idle slot sharing to prevent waste. Assigning by project and job type ensures noisy neighbors like data science ML training jobs cannot starve critical dashboard queries.

### Autoscaling Guardrails and Profiling

Autoscaling slots smooth demand spikes, but aggressive max limits can backfire during long-running ETL windows when all jobs queue simultaneously. Before enabling autoscaling, profile your workload: examine job timelines in the BigQuery console, comparing queued time versus execution time. If jobs spend more than 20% of their lifecycle waiting, you are under-provisioned. Set autoscaling floors at your 50th percentile slot usage and ceilings at the 95th percentile, not the peak. This prevents runaway costs during anomalies like full table scans triggered by missing "WHERE" clauses.

Conservative thresholds also protect against cascading failures when upstream delays cause batch jobs to overlap, creating artificial demand spikes that autoscaling interprets as legitimate load.

### Applied Insight: Optimize Query Plans Before Buying Capacity

Monitor "slot-ms per TB scanned" as your efficiency metric. Values above 50,000 indicate poor query plans, often from missing partition pruning or unfiltered joins. Track shuffle read/write volumes and average concurrent slot utilization in Stackdriver to identify skew where a single stage monopolizes capacity. Partition on date columns, cluster on high-cardinality filter keys, and replace nested subqueries with materialized views. Slots amplify good queries and expose bad ones. Optimizing the execution plan yields 3-5x throughput gains before any pricing model change.
