Modern React applications require thoughtful state management strategies to remain maintainable and performant as they grow.

## The Evolution of State Management

React's built-in state management has evolved significantly:

- **useState** for local component state
- **useReducer** for complex state logic
- **Context API** for prop drilling solutions
- **External libraries** like Redux, Zustand, and Valtio

## Choosing the Right Tool

### Local State with useState

Perfect for component-specific data that doesn't need to be shared:

```jsx
const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
```

### Global State with Zustand

For shared state across components:

```jsx
const useStore = create((set) => ({
  user: null,
  login: (userData) => set({ user: userData }),
}));
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep state as local as possible** - Only lift state when necessary
2. **Use TypeScript** - Ensures type safety across your state management
3. **Separate concerns** - Keep UI state separate from business logic
4. **Optimize re-renders** - Use selectors to prevent unnecessary updates

## Conclusion

Modern React state management is about choosing the right tool for the job. Start simple with local state, and gradually introduce more sophisticated solutions as your application grows.
