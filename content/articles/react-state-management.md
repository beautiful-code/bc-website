keytakeaway: "Modern React state management is about choosing the right tool for the job - start simple with local state, and gradually introduce more sophisticated solutions like Zustand or Redux as your application grows in complexity."

Modern React applications require thoughtful state management strategies to remain maintainable and performant as they grow.

### The Evolution of State Management

React's built-in state management has evolved significantly:

- **useState** for local component state
- **useReducer** for complex state logic
- **Context API** for prop drilling solutions
- **External libraries** like Redux, Zustand, and Valtio

### Local State with useState

Perfect for component-specific data that doesn't need to be shared:

```jsx
const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
```

For shared state across components:

```jsx
const useStore = create((set) => ({
  user: null,
  login: (userData) => set({ user: userData }),
}));
```

### Best Practices

1. **Keep state as local as possible** - Only lift state when necessary
2. **Use TypeScript** - Ensures type safety across your state management
3. **Separate concerns** - Keep UI state separate from business logic
4. **Optimize re-renders** - Use selectors to prevent unnecessary updates
