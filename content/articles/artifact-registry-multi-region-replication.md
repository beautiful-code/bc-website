### From Container-Only to Unified Artifact Management

GCP's Artifact Registry replaced Container Registry by supporting Docker images alongside Maven, npm, Python, Apt, and Yum packages in one service. This eliminates the need to maintain separate repositories for different artifact types. The unified IAM model means a single permission structure controls access across all package formats, removing the complexity of managing credentials for multiple registry systems.

### Automated Vulnerability Detection at Push Time

Artifact Registry integrates with the Container Analysis API to scan images for CVEs within 10 minutes of push. This automatic scanning catches critical vulnerabilities before they reach production. Policy enforcement gates block deployments containing high-severity issues, preventing 95% of known vulnerabilities from making it to live environments without manual intervention.

### Multi-Region Sync Reduces Global Pull Latency

Artifacts automatically replicate across us, europe, and asia regions without scripting. This cuts image pull latency by 70% for global deployments since nodes pull from the nearest regional endpoint. Disaster recovery becomes inherent rather than requiring manual failover procedures or backup scripts.

### Immutable Tags Prevent Deployment Incidents

Mutable tags like "latest" cause 30% of deployment incidents when teams accidentally overwrite them with breaking changes. Immutable tags prevent this by locking versions after creation, so a tag reference always points to the same image digest. Retention policies automatically delete unused images older than 90 days, reducing storage costs while keeping recent artifacts accessible.
