keytakeaway: "Cache hit rates depend entirely on prompt structureâ€”place all static content before dynamic variables to ensure prefix stability and maximize token reuse across requests."

### Understanding Prompt Caching Economics

Prompt caching reduces both latency and cost by storing frequently used prompt segments in memory. When identical prompt prefixes are sent across multiple requests, the LLM provider serves cached tokens instead of reprocessing them. This matters particularly for applications with long system instructions, few-shot examples, or document contexts that remain constant across user interactions. Anthropic requires explicit cache markers using "cache_control" parameters, while OpenAI enables caching automatically for prompts exceeding 1024 tokens. Google's Gemini now offers implicit caching for 2.5 models, automatically detecting reusable content without explicit configuration.

### Provider-Specific Implementation Patterns

Different providers handle cache behavior distinctly. Anthropic's cache has a 5-minute TTL that resets on each hit, making it suitable for conversational applications with frequent user interactions. OpenAI extends cache duration up to an hour during low-traffic periods, though this varies with system load. Gemini 2.5 models default to a 1-hour TTL with configurable duration, and support both explicit caching (via cache object creation) and implicit caching (automatic detection). The critical insight is that cache keys are token-sequence dependent: even a single character change in early tokens invalidates the entire cache.

**Cache Lifecycle Comparison**

| Provider | Default Behavior | TTL | TTL Reset | Min Cacheable Size |
|----------|-----------------|-----|-----------|-------------------|
| Anthropic | Explicit opt-in | 5 mins | On every hit | 1024 tokens |
| OpenAI | Automatic | 5-60 mins | On every hit | 1024 tokens |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash | Implicit/Explicit | 1 hour (default) | On every hit | 1024 tokens |
| Gemini 2.5 Pro | Implicit/Explicit | 1 hour (default) | On every hit | 2048 tokens |

### Prompt Architecture for Cache Optimization

The placement of static versus dynamic content determines cache effectiveness. Static elements like system instructions, few-shot examples, and knowledge base content should occupy the prompt's leading positions. Variable content such as user queries, session-specific context, or real-time data belongs at the end. This structure ensures that prompt prefixes remain identical across requests, maximizing cache hits. A common anti-pattern is interleaving instructions with dynamic placeholders, which breaks cache continuity even when the actual instruction set hasn't changed.

### Applied Insight

Structure prompts with a static prefix containing all reusable content followed by dynamic suffixes. For Anthropic, mark the boundary with "cache_control" after your last static block. For Gemini, leverage implicit caching by structuring prompts consistently, or use explicit caching with cache object IDs for fine-grained control. For production systems expecting sustained traffic, design prompt templates where the first 70-80% remains constant across requests. This architectural decision compounds savings: a cached 10K token system prompt reused across 1000 requests eliminates 10M token processing operations.
