### The Privacy-Computation Trade-off

Federated Learning inverts the traditional ML paradigm by pushing model training to the data source rather than aggregating raw data centrally. Instead of collecting sensitive information from mobile devices or hospital servers into a single data warehouse, the model itself travels to each node, trains locally, and only shares gradient updates back to a central coordinator. This architecture preserves data locality while enabling collaborative learning across distributed sources, making it essential for healthcare diagnostics, keyboard prediction, and financial fraud detection where regulatory constraints or user privacy concerns prohibit data centralization.

### Federated Averaging Workflow

**Code Snippet:**
```python
# Simplified FedAvg aggregation on server
def federated_averaging(client_weights, client_samples):
    total_samples = sum(client_samples)
    global_weights = {}
    
    for key in client_weights[0].keys():
        global_weights[key] = sum(
            w[key] * (n / total_samples) 
            for w, n in zip(client_weights, client_samples)
        )
    
    return global_weights
```

The server broadcasts the current global model to participating clients. Each client trains on local data for several epochs, computing weight deltas without exposing raw samples. Clients then transmit only these updated parameters back to the server, which performs weighted averaging based on local dataset sizes. This "FedAvg" strategy balances contribution fairness while reducing communication rounds compared to synchronous SGD across all nodes.

### Non-IID Data and Convergence Challenges

Real-world federated deployments encounter heterogeneous data distributions across clients. A hospital in rural areas may see different disease patterns than urban centers, and mobile keyboards reflect individual writing styles rather than uniform language usage. This statistical heterogeneity causes model drift during local training, where each client pulls the global model toward its own data bias. Convergence slows significantly, and the aggregated model may perform poorly on underrepresented data distributions. Techniques like personalized layers, adaptive learning rates per client, or clustering clients by data similarity help mitigate these non-IID effects.

### Applied Insight: When to Federate

Choose Federated Learning when data cannot move due to privacy regulations, bandwidth constraints, or competitive moats between organizations. Expect 2-5x longer training times compared to centralized approaches due to communication overhead and client availability issues. Use differential privacy on weight updates to defend against gradient inversion attacks that reconstruct training samples. Federated Learning shines in cross-silo scenarios like multi-hospital collaborations or mobile device fleets, but reconsider if you control all data sources and can centralize securely.
