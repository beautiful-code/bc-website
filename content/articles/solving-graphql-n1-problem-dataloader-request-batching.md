### The N+1 Query Trap in Field-Level Resolution

GraphQL's field-level resolution model creates N+1 problems by default. When a query requests a list of posts with their authors, the resolver fetches posts in one query, then triggers a separate database call for each post's author field. A response with 100 posts generates 101 database queries: one for the post list, plus 100 individual author lookups.

This isn't a bug but an architectural consequence. REST endpoints typically join related data upfront because the server controls response shape. GraphQL defers resolution to individual field resolvers, prioritizing flexibility over batching. Without intervention, each field resolver operates independently, unaware that other resolvers need the same data.

### DataLoader's Per-Request Batching Pattern

DataLoader solves N+1 by collecting requests during a single execution cycle and batching them into one database call. When multiple resolvers call `userLoader.load(userId)`, DataLoader queues these IDs, then issues a single `getUsersByIds([1, 2, 3])` query on the next event loop tick.

```javascript
const DataLoader = require('dataloader');

// Batch function: receives array of keys, returns array of values
const batchGetUsers = async (userIds) => {
  const users = await db.query(
    'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ANY($1)',
    [userIds]
  );
  // Return users in same order as requested IDs
  return userIds.map(id => users.find(u => u.id === id));
};

// Create new loader per request
const createLoaders = () => ({
  userLoader: new DataLoader(batchGetUsers)
});

// In resolver context
const resolvers = {
  Post: {
    author: (post, args, { loaders }) => {
      return loaders.userLoader.load(post.authorId);
    }
  }
};
```

The critical implementation detail: instantiate DataLoader per GraphQL request, not globally. Per-request instances ensure caches clear after each response, preventing stale data while maintaining batching benefits within that request's execution.

### Query Complexity as a Security Layer

GraphQL's nesting flexibility enables denial-of-service attacks. A client can request deeply nested relationships that exponentially increase database load. Query depth and complexity analysis are mandatory defenses, not optional optimizations.

Depth limiting caps nesting levels, while complexity scoring assigns costs to fields. Expensive operations like list fields carry higher costs than scalar fields. The server rejects queries exceeding configured thresholds before execution begins, protecting against malicious or poorly constructed queries that would otherwise overwhelm the database.

### When DataLoader Fits Your Stack

DataLoader works best when your data access layer supports batch loading by IDs and when resolvers frequently request the same entities. It's essential for GraphQL APIs serving relational data where N+1 patterns emerge naturally. The per-request batching model means zero configuration for cache invalidation, making it safer than shared caches.

Skip DataLoader when your queries already join data efficiently, or when batch operations aren't supported by your datastore. For document databases with denormalized data, N+1 problems occur less frequently. Always pair DataLoader with query complexity limitsâ€”batching solves performance, but complexity analysis prevents abuse.
