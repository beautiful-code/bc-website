keytakeaway: "ML models are sensitive to library implementation changes, so containerizing the entire environment with locked dependencies is the only reliable way to prevent silent prediction drift between development and production."

### The Silent Failure of Version Mismatches

A data scientist trains a model locally with "scikit-learn==1.1.0", but production runs "scikit-learn==1.2.0". The model loads without errors, but predictions diverge completely. The culprit: implementation changes in tree-based algorithms between minor versions. Unlike code bugs that crash immediately, this creates silent failures where the model runs but produces wrong outputs. Traditional testing won't catch this because the model's structure is valid, it's the behavior that changed.

### Dependency Locking Strategies

**Artifact: Comparison Table**

| Approach | What It Locks | Production Safety |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| requirements.txt (unpinned) | Package names only | Low - allows version drift |
| requirements.txt (pinned) | Exact package versions | Medium - system dependencies can differ |
| pip freeze output | All installed packages with versions | High - but OS-level libs can still vary |
| Docker with pip freeze | Entire environment including OS | Highest - bit-for-bit reproducibility |

The progression moves from partial to complete environment control. Each step eliminates a class of inconsistency, but only containerization locks the entire runtime stack.

### Containerized Environment Parity

Docker creates identical execution contexts across development, testing, and production. The Dockerfile pins the base image, installs system dependencies, and uses "pip freeze" output for Python packages. This same image runs in CI pipelines and production servers. When a model is trained, the training environment's exact state is captured. The production deployment uses this frozen state, not a loosely specified requirements file. This eliminates drift from OS updates, system library changes, or transitive dependency resolution differences.

### Applied Insight

For ML workloads, version mismatches in numeric libraries can silently corrupt predictions without raising errors. Use Docker with "pip freeze" to guarantee environment consistency from training through deployment. Test using the exact production container image, not just the same Python packages. This approach trades some flexibility for reliability, making it essential when prediction correctness is critical.
