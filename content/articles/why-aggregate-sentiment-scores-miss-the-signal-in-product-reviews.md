### The Problem with Single-Score Sentiment

A 4-star review that praises a hotel's location but criticizes its service gets flattened into a single number. Traditional sentiment classifiers output one label: positive, negative, or neutral, which obscures the nuanced feedback customers actually provide. This aggregation problem becomes critical when stakeholders need to prioritize fixes. Should the hotel invest in staff training or accept that location compensates for service gaps? A single sentiment score can't answer this.

### Breaking Down Sentiment by Aspect

Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis treats reviews as multi-dimensional feedback. Instead of classifying the entire text, ABSA identifies specific targets like "battery life" or "customer service" and extracts opinion phrases tied to each. The system then assigns sentiment polarity per aspect, producing structured output like `{location: positive, service: negative, cleanliness: positive}`.

**Artifact: Core ABSA Pipeline Components**

```python
Input: "The hotel location is great but the staff was rude."

Step 1: Aspect Extraction (NER)
  → Identifies: ["location", "staff"]

Step 2: Opinion Phrase Detection (Dependency Parsing)
  → Maps: location → "is great"
         staff → "was rude"

Step 3: Sentiment Classification
  → Assigns: {location: positive, staff: negative}
```

### Technical Implementation Strategy

ABSA typically combines Named Entity Recognition models to identify aspects with dependency parsing to link them to opinion phrases. Pre-trained transformers like BERT can be fine-tuned on domain-specific aspect-sentiment pairs. The challenge lies in handling implicit aspects, when a review says "charging takes forever" without explicitly mentioning "battery", which requires co-reference resolution or domain lexicons. Libraries like "spaCy" handle dependency trees, while "transformers" from Huggingface provide the sentiment classification backbone.

### Applied Insight

Use ABSA when feedback needs to drive specific operational decisions rather than track overall satisfaction trends. It's particularly valuable in e-commerce, hospitality, and SaaS where discrete features have independent development cycles. The tradeoff is complexity: ABSA requires labeled aspect-sentiment data and more sophisticated NLP pipelines than binary classifiers, but the structured output becomes immediately actionable for product teams prioritizing roadmaps.
