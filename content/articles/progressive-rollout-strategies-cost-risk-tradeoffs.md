### Weighted Traffic Progression and Blast Radius Control

Canary deployments use graduated traffic shifts—5%, 25%, 50%, 100%—to validate new versions under real production load before full deployment. Each increment serves as a validation gate where the new version must prove stability before expanding reach. The gradual approach limits blast radius during early phases, ensuring issues affect only a small user segment while the majority remains on the stable version.

Traffic weighting happens at the routing layer, enabling real-time adjustments without DNS propagation delays. The key advantage lies in risk containment—when problems surface at 5% traffic, rollback affects minimal users while providing sufficient signal for issue detection. This graduated validation creates natural checkpoints where teams can pause, observe metrics, and make informed decisions about progression.

**Implementation Options in GKE:**
GKE supports progressive rollouts through multiple approaches—GKE Gateway (Gateway API) provides native weighted traffic splitting via HTTPRoute configuration, Istio service mesh offers fine-grained traffic management with VirtualServices, and native Kubernetes achieves basic canary deployments using multiple Deployments with label selectors to control pod ratios.

### Progressive Rollout Patterns

**Strategy Definitions:**

| Strategy | Description | Rollback Time | Infrastructure Cost |
|----------|-------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Canary | Gradual traffic shift (5%→25%→50%→100%) to new version | 5-30 minutes | 1x + small overhead |
| Blue-Green | Two full environments, instant switch between versions | 30 seconds | 2x during transition |
| Feature Flags | Code deployed but features controlled via runtime toggles | Seconds (flag flip) | 1x |

**Automated Rollback Thresholds:**

| Metric | Threshold | Impact |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Error Rate | >1% | Triggers immediate revert |
| P99 Latency | >500ms | Triggers immediate revert |
| Traffic Cap | 5% | Limits maximum user exposure (canary only) |

Automated rollback mechanisms monitor golden signals continuously during progression. Error rate above 1% or P99 latency exceeding 500ms triggers immediate traffic reversion. These thresholds integrate with monitoring systems to remove human reaction time from incident response. The 5% traffic cap ensures that even with monitoring delays, maximum user impact remains bounded. Traditional manual rollbacks take 10-15 minutes from detection to execution; automation reduces this to under 60 seconds.

### Cost-Performance Economics Across Strategies

The fundamental trade-off between rollout strategies boils down to rollback speed versus infrastructure cost. Canary deployments optimize for cost efficiency—running primarily on existing infrastructure with minimal overhead—but require 5-30 minutes for complete rollback depending on traffic distribution and monitoring latency. Blue-green provides sub-minute rollback by maintaining two complete production environments, but doubles infrastructure costs during the transition window.

For high-availability services where every minute of degradation has significant revenue impact, the 2x cost premium of blue-green justifies itself. A financial trading platform or payment gateway benefits from instant rollback capability. For less critical services—internal tools, batch processing systems—canary's gradual approach offers better cost efficiency despite slower rollback. The calculation shifts based on mean time to detect issues: if monitoring catches problems within the first 5% traffic increment, canary's rollback time becomes acceptable even for critical services.

Feature flags represent a third option that decouples deployment from release. Code ships to production but remains inactive until flag activation, enabling instant rollback via configuration change rather than infrastructure manipulation. This approach provides blue-green's rollback speed at canary's cost profile, though it requires upfront investment in flag infrastructure and adds code complexity.

### Applied Deployment Decision Framework

Choose your rollout strategy based on service criticality and acceptable recovery time. Use canary deployments for cost-sensitive services where 5-30 minute rollback is acceptable—the graduated traffic approach provides early warning signals while minimizing infrastructure spend. Deploy blue-green for revenue-critical services requiring instant rollback, accepting the 2x cost during transition windows as insurance against prolonged outages.

Combine feature flags with either strategy to separate deployment from release. Deploy code to 100% of infrastructure with features disabled, then progressively enable using flags while monitoring impact. This eliminates blue-green's infrastructure cost while maintaining fine-grained control over feature exposure. Rollback becomes a flag toggle completing in seconds without traffic disruption. The pattern works particularly well for A/B testing scenarios where canary deployments target specific user segments—beta testers or geographic regions—for controlled validation before broad release.
