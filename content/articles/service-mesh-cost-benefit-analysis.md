### What Service Mesh Is and Why It Exists

Service mesh is infrastructure layer that handles service-to-service communication by injecting sidecar proxies alongside each service. As microservice architectures grow, every service needs mutual TLS, traffic management, observability, and circuit breaking. Without service mesh, each team implements these cross-cutting concerns in application code using different libraries and patterns across Python, Java, Go, and Node.js services. This creates the distributed monolith problem where changing security policies or adding retries requires coordinating deployments across dozens of services. Service mesh centralizes these capabilities outside application code.

### The Sidecar Proxy Solution

Service mesh injects sidecar proxies like Envoy alongside each pod. These sidecars intercept all network traffic, providing mutual TLS encryption, traffic routing, and observability without modifying application code. Traffic from Service A to Service B flows through A's sidecar, then to B's sidecar, then to B's container. The trade-off is tangible: expect 10-15% added latency and 20-30% resource overhead per service. But you gain uniform security and traffic policies across all services regardless of programming language.

### Managed vs. Self-Managed Trade-offs

| Aspect              | Anthos Service Mesh      | Open-Source Istio        |
|---------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Control Plane       | Fully managed            | Self-managed             |
| Monthly Maintenance | ~2 hours                 | 40+ hours                |
| Cost                | $73/vCPU/month           | Zero licensing           |
| Support             | SLA-backed               | Community-driven         |
| GCP Integration     | Native (Trace, Logging)  | Manual setup required    |
| Flexibility         | Limited customization    | Full control             |

ASM offers automatic updates and deep GCP integration but locks you into Google's upgrade cycle. Self-managed Istio demands significant operational investment but gives complete control over configuration and timing.

### Gateway API as the Simpler Path

GKE's Gateway API provides L7 load balancing, TLS termination, and traffic splitting without sidecars. This matters when your needs stop at basic ingress routing. If you don't require service-to-service mTLS, inter-service observability, or advanced policies like retries and timeouts, Gateway API eliminates the sidecar overhead entirely. It's the right choice for architectures where external traffic management is the primary concern, not internal service communication.

### Adoption Strategy That Works

Start with 2-3 non-critical services to learn the operational reality: config validation complexity, debugging sidecar networking issues, certificate rotation mechanics. Once you understand these challenges, expand to the 20-50% of services that genuinely benefit from advanced features like automatic mTLS (which prevents 70% of lateral movement attacks) and fine-grained authorization policies. The anti-pattern is deploying service mesh everywhere upfront and spending months troubleshooting networking issues your architecture didn't require.
