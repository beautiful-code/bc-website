### The Layer 7 Blind Spot

Traditional firewalls operate at network layers 3-4, inspecting IP addresses, ports, and protocols. They block unauthorized network access but cannot inspect HTTP request payloads, headers, or application logic. A SQL injection attack arrives on port 443 as legitimate HTTPS traffic, bypassing network firewalls entirely because the firewall sees encrypted traffic to an allowed port.

Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) operate at layer 7, parsing HTTP requests to detect malicious patterns in URLs, headers, cookies, and POST data. They identify OWASP Top 10 attacks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and remote code execution by analyzing request content, not just network metadata. Common WAF implementations include Cloud Armor (Google Cloud), AWS WAF, Cloudflare WAF, and Imperva for cloud deployments, or on-premise solutions like ModSecurity and F5 Advanced WAF.

### WAF Request Inspection Architecture

WAFs intercept HTTP/HTTPS requests before they reach application servers, evaluating each request against security rules. The inspection happens in real-time with minimal latency, typically adding 1-5ms per request.

**WAF Inspection Points:**

```text
Request URL and query parameters
HTTP headers (User-Agent, Referer, custom headers)
POST body content and form data
Cookies and session tokens
Request method and protocol version
Geographic origin and IP reputation
```

Rules define patterns to block: regex matching SQL keywords in parameters, detecting XSS payloads in form fields, or identifying known malicious user agents. Unlike traditional firewalls that use simple IP/port matching, WAFs require deep packet inspection and content parsing, which demands significantly more processing power.

### Beyond Static Rules: Behavioral Analysis

Modern WAFs combine signature-based detection with behavioral analysis. Signature rules block known attack patterns, but zero-day exploits require behavioral detection. Rate limiting identifies credential stuffing attempts when a single IP tries 1000 login requests in 60 seconds. Bot detection analyzes request timing, header consistency, and JavaScript execution to distinguish humans from automated scrapers.

Traditional firewalls cannot implement these dynamic protections because they lack application context. A firewall sees individual packets; a WAF understands user sessions, request sequences, and application workflows. This context enables sophisticated protections like blocking users who access admin endpoints without proper authentication flow, even if each individual request appears legitimate.

### Cloud Armor as Distributed Edge WAF

Cloud Armor implements WAF capabilities at Google's edge network across 100+ locations, filtering malicious traffic before it reaches your GKE clusters or Cloud Run services. It leverages Google's threat intelligence from analyzing 100+ billion daily requests, automatically updating rules for emerging vulnerabilities like Log4Shell within 24 hours.

The edge deployment provides DDoS protection at 2.5 Tbps scale, absorbing volumetric attacks before they consume your infrastructure resources. Security policies define rules using geographic blocking, IP reputation, custom CEL expressions, and integration with reCAPTCHA Enterprise for bot management. However, tuning requires 2-4 weeks of monitoring false positives where legitimate traffic needs exception handling.
