keytakeaway: "Effective LLM evaluation requires private task-specific benchmarks, statistical sampling to handle prompt sensitivity, and production observability to catch failures that synthetic tests miss."

### Prompt Sensitivity and Output Variance

LLMs exhibit fragile behavior under prompt variations. A single word change can shift output quality significantly, making deterministic evaluation unreliable. The standard approach of running one test case per prompt fails to capture this variance. Production systems need version-controlled prompts with multiple sampling runs per test case. Measure both mean performance and standard deviation across runs. High variance signals brittle prompts that need restructuring before deployment.

Temperature and top-p settings compound this issue. Lower temperatures reduce variance but don't eliminate prompt sensitivity. The solution is statistical evaluation: run 5-10 samples per test case, track distribution of scores, and set variance thresholds as part of your acceptance criteria.

### Evaluation Framework Components

```python
def evaluate_with_variance(prompt, test_cases, samples=5):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        scores = []
        for _ in range(samples):
            output = llm.generate(prompt, case["input"])
            score = domain_scorer(output, case["expected"])
            scores.append(score)
        
        mean_score = np.mean(scores)
        variance = np.std(scores)
        
        results.append({
            "case_id": case["id"],
            "mean": mean_score,
            "variance": variance,
            "pass": mean_score > 0.8 and variance < 0.15
        })
    
    return results
```

This implementation runs multiple samples per test case and tracks both accuracy and consistency. The variance threshold catches brittle prompts before deployment. Combined with regression tests on model updates, this approach provides statistical confidence that single-run evaluations cannot deliver.

### The Confidence Trap and Model Updates

Model confidence scores and logprobs are poor proxies for correctness. High-confidence hallucinations occur frequently, particularly in knowledge-sparse domains. Evaluating "logprobs" or sampling temperature tells you nothing about factual accuracy or task completion. Always evaluate the actual output against ground truth, not the model's self-assessment.

Model version updates create silent failures. When "GPT-4" becomes "GPT-4.5" or Anthropic releases Claude updates, carefully tuned prompts and few-shot examples may degrade. Comprehensive regression test suites become your safety net. Run full evaluation on new model versions before switching, comparing output quality distributions rather than single-point metrics. Version pinning in production gives you control over when to adopt updates.

### Applied Insight: Build Private Task-Specific Benchmarks

Public benchmarks like MMLU and HumanEval saturate quickly as models optimize for them, creating misleading capability signals. Companies game these scores without improving real-world utility. Medical AI needs citation accuracy and diagnostic precision; legal systems need clause detection and precedent matching; marketing tools need brand voice consistency. Generic benchmarks miss these requirements entirely.

Build private evaluation datasets that mirror your production distribution. Include edge cases, adversarial examples, and domain-specific failure modes. Combine pre-deployment test suites with production observability tracking latency, token usage, and user engagement signals like edit distance and acceptance rates. This dual approach catches both pre-release regressions and post-deployment drift that test suites alone cannot detect.
