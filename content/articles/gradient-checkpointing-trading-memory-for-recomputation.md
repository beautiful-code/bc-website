### The Memory Bottleneck in Deep Networks

Training large transformer models requires storing all intermediate activations during the forward pass for backpropagation. For a 12-layer transformer with batch size 32, this can consume 8-12GB of VRAM just for activations, separate from model weights and optimizer states. When training embedding-heavy architectures or vision transformers with high-resolution inputs, activation memory becomes the primary constraint preventing larger batch sizes or deeper networks from fitting on available GPU hardware.

### Selective Activation Checkpointing Strategy

Rather than storing every layer's activations, gradient checkpointing saves only a subset of strategically chosen checkpoints during the forward pass. During backpropagation, the missing activations are recomputed on-the-fly from the nearest checkpoint.

**Checkpointing Strategy Comparison**

| Strategy | Activations Stored | Recomputation Cost | Memory Savings |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| No Checkpointing | All layers (100%) | None | Baseline |
| Every 2nd Layer | 50% of layers | 1x forward per layer | ~40% reduction |
| Every 4th Layer | 25% of layers | 3x forward per layer | ~65% reduction |
| Block-Level | Block boundaries only | Full block recompute | ~70% reduction |

The block-level approach works particularly well with transformer architectures, checkpointing only at attention block boundaries while recomputing the feed-forward and normalization layers during backprop.

### Impact on Training Dynamics

Gradient checkpointing increases training time by approximately 20-30% due to recomputation overhead, but this cost is offset by enabling 2-3x larger batch sizes. Larger batches improve gradient stability, reduce noise in parameter updates, and can accelerate convergence when learning rates are scaled appropriately. For models like BERT or GPT variants, this means fitting batch sizes of 64-96 instead of 24-32 on a single 24GB GPU, directly improving training throughput despite the per-step slowdown.

### Applied Insight: When to Checkpoint

Use gradient checkpointing when activation memory exceeds 40% of available VRAM, particularly for sequence lengths above 512 tokens or when training models with more than 8 transformer layers. Avoid it for small models or short sequences where the recomputation overhead outweighs memory benefits. For production training runs, combine checkpointing with mixed-precision training and gradient accumulation to maximize both memory efficiency and computational throughput.
