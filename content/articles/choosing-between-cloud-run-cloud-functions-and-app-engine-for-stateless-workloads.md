### Understanding Serverless Compute

Serverless computing abstracts away server management—you deploy code, and the cloud provider handles provisioning, scaling, and infrastructure maintenance. Unlike VM-based deployments where you manage operating systems and capacity planning, serverless platforms scale automatically from zero to thousands of instances based on incoming requests. You pay only for actual compute time (billed per 100ms), not for idle server capacity. The trade-off is accepting platform constraints like execution time limits, stateless architecture, and cold start latency when instances spin up after idle periods.

GCP offers three primary serverless compute options: Cloud Run for containerized applications, Cloud Functions for event-driven code execution, and App Engine for managed web applications with built-in services.

### The Container Portability Trade-off

Cloud Run emerged as the default serverless choice because it runs any containerized application without Kubernetes overhead. With 4GB memory limits, 60-minute request timeouts, and native support for HTTP/2, gRPC, and WebSockets, it handles Django apps, Node.js services, and Go binaries equally well. The container-first approach means you can develop locally with Docker and deploy the exact same artifact to production, eliminating runtime surprises. This portability comes at the cost of managing your own Dockerfile and understanding container optimization, but for teams already familiar with containers, Cloud Run provides the most flexible foundation for 80% of serverless workloads.

### Event-Driven Architecture Patterns

Cloud Functions excels when you need tight integration with GCP's event ecosystem. Built on Cloud Run infrastructure (2nd gen), it automatically wires up 40+ event sources including Pub/Sub messages, Cloud Storage uploads, and Firestore document changes. The runtime management abstracts away container concerns entirely—you write a single handler function, and GCP provisions the Node.js, Python, Go, or Java environment. Cold starts stay under 5 seconds through aggressive runtime caching and pre-warmed instances.

| Event Source | Use Case | Typical Latency |
|--------------|----------|-----------------|
| Pub/Sub | Async message processing | 100-500ms |
| Cloud Storage | File processing pipelines | 1-3s |
| Firestore | Real-time data sync | 200-800ms |
| Cloud Scheduler | Cron jobs | 50-200ms |

This pattern works best for glue code under 1000 lines where event routing logic outweighs business logic complexity.

### Cold Start and Scaling Characteristics

App Engine Standard delivers 100ms cold starts through its specialized sandbox runtime, making it the fastest option for traffic spikes from zero. Built-in services like Memcache, task queues, and cron scheduling reduce external dependencies. However, runtime versions lock you into specific language releases (Python 3.11, Node.js 20), limiting library compatibility. App Engine Flexible runs custom Docker containers and supports SSH access for debugging, but sacrifices sub-second scaling and always maintains minimum one instance, increasing baseline costs. The Standard environment's opinionated architecture trades flexibility for operational simplicity.

### Stateless Request Lifecycle Implications

Serverless architectures fundamentally alter application design around ephemeral compute. Each Cloud Run or Cloud Functions request receives a fresh container instance where local filesystem writes vanish post-response and in-memory state doesn't persist across requests. Sessions require external stores like Redis or Cloud SQL with connection pooling strategies to handle the rapid connect-disconnect cycles. Database connections can't be held open between invocations—you initialize connections per request or use connection poolers like Cloud SQL Proxy. This stateless constraint eliminates sticky session architectures and forces explicit external state management, but enables horizontal scaling without coordination overhead.
