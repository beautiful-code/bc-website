### The Hallucination Problem in Complex Reasoning

Large language models struggle with complex tasks that require multiple logical steps. When asked to solve mathematical problems or multi-hop reasoning tasks directly, models often jump to conclusions without showing their work, leading to confident but incorrect responses. The core issue is that models attempt to compress the entire reasoning process into a single output step, which increases the likelihood of errors compounding silently. This becomes especially problematic in production systems where reliability matters more than speed.

### Breaking Down Reasoning with Chain-of-Thought

Chain-of-Thought prompting instructs models to articulate their reasoning process step by step before arriving at a final answer. Instead of asking "What is the answer?", you prompt the model to explain "how" it arrives at the answer. This technique forces the model to externalize its intermediate reasoning steps, making the thought process visible and verifiable.

**Common CoT Patterns**

Zero-Shot CoT:

```text
Prompt: "Let's think step by step. A train travels 120 km 
in 2 hours, then 180 km in 3 hours. What is the average speed?"

Response: "Step 1: Calculate total distance: 120 + 180 = 300 km
Step 2: Calculate total time: 2 + 3 = 5 hours  
Step 3: Average speed = 300 / 5 = 60 km/h"
```

Few-Shot CoT (with examples):

```text
Example: Q: If 5 apples cost $10, how much do 8 apples cost?
A: Step 1: Cost per apple = $10 / 5 = $2
   Step 2: Cost of 8 apples = 8 Ã— $2 = $16

Now solve: Q: [your question]
```

### The CoT@32 Strategy for Critical Tasks

Google's CoT@32 approach demonstrates the value of sampling multiple reasoning paths for high-stakes problems. The technique calls the model 32 times with the same CoT prompt, then aggregates responses to find the most consistent answer. This ensemble method catches errors that might appear in individual reasoning chains. While computationally expensive, it proves effective for benchmarking and scenarios where accuracy outweighs cost, such as medical diagnosis support or financial analysis.

### Applied Insight: When to Use Chain-of-Thought

Use CoT prompting when your task involves mathematical calculations, logical dependencies, or requires verifiable intermediate steps. It works best for problems where showing the work is as valuable as the answer itself. Skip CoT for simple retrieval tasks or creative writing where explicit reasoning adds unnecessary overhead. For production systems handling complex queries, consider sampling multiple CoT responses and using consistency as a confidence signal. The technique reduces hallucinations by making errors visible rather than hidden in the final output.
