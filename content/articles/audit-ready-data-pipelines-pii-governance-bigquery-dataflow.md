keytakeaway: "Enforce PII governance at pipeline build time through CI-gated policy tags, provenance logs, and deterministic tokenization, then expose data only via views that join consent and masking logic to make compliance verifiable by design."

### Column-Level PII Tagging as CI Gate

Traditional data governance relies on post-deployment audits to catch untagged sensitive columns. This creates compliance risk when new fields slip through review. By enforcing Data Catalog policy tags at merge time, every schema change must declare column sensitivity and ownership before landing. A pre-commit hook or CI linter scans BigQuery schema definitions for new columns without policy tags and fails the build. Additionally, flag any column tagged as PII that lacks Row-Level Security or an Authorized View. This prevents raw PII exposure from ever reaching production. The enforcement happens at code review, not during an annual audit.

### PII Access Visibility from Audit Logs

**Artifact: Queryable Access Patterns**

| Metric                           | Source                                   | Detection Logic                              |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Principal queries on PII columns | BigQuery Audit Logs + INFORMATION_SCHEMA | Join job metadata with Data Catalog tags     |
| Row counts scanned               | INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS                  | Extract from "totalSlotMs" and "billedBytes" |
| Egress size anomalies            | VPC Flow Logs + Cloud Logging            | Threshold alerts on bucket exports           |
| Unauthorized table access        | Cloud Audit Logs                         | Policy tag violations + IAM deny events      |

Rather than relying on manual access reviews, pipe BigQuery Audit Logs and INFORMATION_SCHEMA metadata into a dedicated monitoring dataset. Cross-reference query jobs with Data Catalog policy tags to identify which principals accessed PII-tagged columns, when, and how much data moved. Flag anomalies like sudden spikes in row scans or egress to external buckets. This creates a live audit trail where compliance teams query access patterns using SQL instead of reviewing spreadsheets. Every PII touch becomes evidence on demand.

### Deterministic Tokenization at Ingestion

Rather than passing raw email addresses or user IDs through the pipeline, apply keyed tokenization during ingestion using Cloud DLP's crypto-based transformations or KMS-backed HMAC. The same plaintext always yields the same token, preserving join keys and aggregation logic downstream. Analysts work entirely with pseudonymous identifiers. The re-identification keys live in a separate Google Cloud project with restrictive IAM policies and time-bound access approvals. This architectural boundary ensures that even with full BigQuery access, users cannot reverse tokens without crossing an audit-logged IAM policy boundary.

### Applied Insight: Views as Enforcement Layer

Instead of granting direct table access, maintain a central "user_consent" table and expose data exclusively through Authorized Views that join consent conditions or apply policy-tag column masking. When a user queries the view, BigQuery enforces the masking or filtering logic server-side. This pattern shifts access control from folklore and runbooks into enforceable SQL definitions versioned in git. Combine this with append-only partitioned tables and immutable table snapshots for BI consumption. Auditors gain time-travel capabilities to reconstruct any historical state, and rollbacks never require rewriting data.
