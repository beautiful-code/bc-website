### Explanation in layman terms

Imagine you're assembling a complex piece of furniture with dozens of parts and intricate mechanisms. You have two choices: dive straight into assembly following your intuition, or first lay out all the pieces and understand what the final result should look like at each step.

Writing tests first when dealing with tricky logic is like having a detailed checklist that tells you exactly what each piece should do before you start building. When you're implementing complex algorithms, handling multiple edge cases, or building intricate business rules, tests act as your specification and safety net combined.

The beauty of leading with tests is that complex logic becomes a series of small, manageable problems. Instead of trying to solve an entire algorithm at once, you write one test that says "when I give this input, I expect this specific output." Then you write just enough code to make that test pass. You repeat this cycle, gradually building up complexity while ensuring each piece works correctly.

This approach is especially powerful for tricky logic because it forces you to think through all the scenarios upfront--the happy path, edge cases, error conditions, and boundary values. By the time you're done implementing, you have both working code and a comprehensive suite of tests that document exactly how your complex logic should behave.

### Put it into practice?

| Scenario | What to do |
| :---- | :---- |
| When writing a data transformation function with multiple input formats | Start with tests for the most common data format, then add tests for edge cases, malformed data, and empty inputs. Build the transformation incrementally |
| When building a state machine with multiple transitions and conditions | Create tests for each state transition, invalid transitions, and boundary conditions. Map out the expected behavior through failing tests first |
| When creating a validation system with intricate business rules | Create tests that define each business rule explicitly. Write failing tests for valid inputs, invalid inputs, and edge cases in isolation |
