### Explanation in layman terms

Think of AI as that overconfident coworker who always sounds like they know exactly what they're doing, speaks with absolute certainty, and delivers their work with impressive speed. They never say "I'm not sure" or "let me double-check this." Everything they produce looks professional and well-structured.

But here's the catch: confidence doesn't equal competence.

AI coding assistants are trained on millions of lines of code from the internet - including plenty of buggy, insecure, and outdated examples. When AI generates code, it's essentially creating a sophisticated remix of patterns it has seen before, delivered with unwavering confidence. It doesn't understand the business context of your application, can't grasp the security implications of mixing certain functions, and has no awareness of your specific system's constraints.

The dangerous part? AI-generated code often looks completely correct. It follows proper syntax, uses reasonable variable names, and appears to solve the problem. But beneath the surface, it might contain SQL injection vulnerabilities, missing input validation, hardcoded credentials, or logic flaws that only surface under specific conditions.

This is why treating AI like a junior developer is the perfect analogy. A junior developer can write code that compiles and runs, but you wouldn't deploy their work without careful review, testing, and validation. The same principle applies to AI: leverage its speed and capability, but never skip the human oversight that ensures the code is secure, efficient, and appropriate for your specific context.

### Put it into practice?

| Scenario | What to do |
| :---- | :---- |
| When an AI generates a database query or API endpoint | Never deploy without testing edge cases, validating input sanitization, checking SQL injection vulnerabilities, and reviewing |
| When AI-generated code passes all existing tests | Don't assume it's production-ready. AI often misses edge cases that existing tests don't cover. Write additional tests for boundary conditions, error scenarios, and integration points |
| When AI suggests a "quick fix" for a production bug | Treat it as a starting point, not a final solution. Manually trace through the logic, understand root causes, write tests to reproduce the bug, and verify the fix doesn't introduce new issues |
