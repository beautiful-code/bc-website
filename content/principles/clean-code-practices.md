![Clean Code Practices](/principles/clean-code-practices/comic.png)

### Explanation in layman terms

Clean code is not just about aestheticsâ€”it's about maintainability, collaboration, and long-term project success. When code is clean and readable:

- **New team members can onboard faster**
- **Bugs are easier to identify and fix**
- **Features can be added more quickly**
- **Technical debt is minimized**

The essence of clean code lies in its readability and maintainability. It's code that other developers (including your future self) can understand quickly and modify safely. Clean code follows established conventions, uses meaningful names, and is structured logically.

### Put it into practice?

**Use Meaningful Names**
Variables, functions, and classes should have names that clearly express their purpose:

```javascript
// Bad
const d = new Date();
const fn = (x) => x * 2;

// Good
const currentDate = new Date();
const doubleValue = (value) => value * 2;
```

**Follow Single Responsibility Principle**
Each function and class should have one reason to change:

```javascript
// Bad - multiple responsibilities
function processUserData(user) {
  // Validate user data
  // Save to database
  // Send email notification
  // Update analytics
}

// Good - single responsibility
function validateUserData(user) {
  // Only validation logic
}

function saveUserToDatabase(user) {
  // Only database operations
}
```

**Keep Functions Small and Focused**
A good rule of thumb is that a function should fit on one screen:

```javascript
// Bad - too long and complex
function calculateOrderTotal(order) {
  let total = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < order.items.length; i++) {
    const item = order.items[i];
    const price = item.price;
    const quantity = item.quantity;
    const itemTotal = price * quantity;
    total += itemTotal;
  }
  if (order.customer.type === "VIP") {
    total = total * 0.9; // 10% discount
  }
  if (order.shipping === "express") {
    total += 15;
  }
  return total;
}

// Good - broken into smaller functions
function calculateOrderTotal(order) {
  const subtotal = calculateSubtotal(order.items);
  const discountedTotal = applyDiscount(subtotal, order.customer);
  return addShippingCost(discountedTotal, order.shipping);
}
```

**Maintain Consistent Formatting**
Use consistent indentation, spacing, and naming conventions throughout your codebase. This includes consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces), consistent naming conventions (camelCase, snake_case, etc.), consistent file organization, and consistent import/export patterns.

**Write Comments When Necessary**
Good code is self-documenting, but sometimes comments are needed for complex business logic:

```javascript
// Good - explains the "why" not the "what"
function calculateTax(amount, state) {
  // Apply state-specific tax rates
  // Some states have different rates for different income brackets
  const taxRate = getStateTaxRate(state, amount);
  return amount * taxRate;
}
```

**Use Quality Tools**
We use several tools to maintain code quality:

- **ESLint** for consistent code style
- **Prettier** for automatic formatting
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Unit tests** to ensure code works as expected
- **Code reviews** to catch issues early

**Code Review Checklist**
Before submitting code for review, ask yourself:

- Are variable and function names clear and descriptive?
- Are functions small and focused on a single task?
- Is the code easy to read and understand?
- Are there any magic numbers or hardcoded values?
- Is the code consistent with the existing codebase style?
- Are there any obvious performance issues?

Clean code is an investment in the future. The time spent writing clean, readable code today saves countless hours of debugging and maintenance tomorrow. Remember: code is written once but read many times. Make it count.
